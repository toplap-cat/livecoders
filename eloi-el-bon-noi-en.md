# Eloi el Bon Noi

## What?
Eloi el Bon Noi uses a live coding set to produce a series of sound sculptures, a collection of
pieces with complex, self-generating structures that are never repeated in the same way due to
algorithm writing in which iterations, randomness and uncertainty are of great importance. His
music contrasts between moments of intense saturation of the spectre alongside moments of
pointillist minimalism, or harmonies with fragments of noise and glitch.

## Who?
An active member of the live coder community in Barcelona, Eloi el Bon Noi likes to see himself
as a composer capable of performing his own work by his own means. He has performed in many
artistic events using the code in a creative way. He also gives workshops and lectures on live
coding.
He has been selected to present his work at festivals such as LEM (2022), Mutek (2022), VIU
(2021, 2023) among others. He has presented his work "Màquines de terrabastall" at the ICLC,
the international live coding conference held in Utrecht.
He is part of a spoken word and live coding duet together with the writer and philosopher Eloy
Fernández Porta. This duet has been performed at literature and contemporary art festivals such
as Brama! in Masnou, Literatura en trànsit in Barcelona, the Fundación Telefónica in Madrid,
Barcelona Poesia and Poesia i +.
